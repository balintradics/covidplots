To use:

* Download the two python source codes to a folder
* Create a folder named "data"
* Edit with 'makeplots_auto.py' with more or fewer countries/provinces
* Run 'makeplots_auto.py' with python3

Note: sometimes Johns Hopkins updates the github csv files. In this case
just delete all files from "data" and the code will redownload them fresh.
